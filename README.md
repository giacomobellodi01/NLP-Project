## NLP Project - Harnessing Large Language Models for organic spoiler detection and rephrasing in movie reviews

### Abstract

Spoilers in reviews can damage the enjoy- ment of entertainment products. Therefore, review platforms focus on detecting and flag- ging them. Unfortunately, this practice censors potentially valuable reviews. Large language models (LLMs) may represent a powerful tool to overcome this problem. We implement mul- tiple classifiers, we utilize LLMs to generate paraphrased, spoiler-free reviews and we pro- pose a novel evaluation score, the S5, to as- sess their performance. After testing various models, the DistilBERT classifier emerges as the most effective, achieving a 68% macro F1 score. This performs well compared to state- of-the-art models and surpasses our established baseline. Moreover, the S5 effectively eval- uates the LLMs paraphrases, considering the spoiler removal. This organic approach can improve user interaction with platforms by au- tomatically detecting spoilers and modifying re- views, preventing the reader from being harmed and the writer from feeling censored.
